 Summary 
So what I talked about is that The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939. It began in the U.S. after the stock market crash in October 1929. Since the U.S. was the world's largest economy, other countries like the UK and Germany also struggled. Before the Depression, the 1920s, known as the "Roaring Twenties," was a time of economic growth, but it caused inequality, with the rich getting richer and the poor staying the same. Banks gave out risky loans, leading to debt. After the crash, unemployment reached 25%, many farmers lost their land, and half the countryâ€™s banks failed. President Hoover didn't do enough, so Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 election and introduced the New Deal to help the economy. Some reasons for why I used the Audio's that I used is because the music was popular around the time of the great depression the three biggest ones were Jazz, Blues, and Swing.
